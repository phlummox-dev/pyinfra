# Contributing

ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for taking the time to contribute to `pyinfra`! ðŸŽ‰

Third party pull requests help expand pyinfra's functionality and are essential to it's continued growth. This guide should help get you started adding additional operations, facts and other functionality to pyinfra.

## Guides

+ [How to write operations](api/operations)
+ [How to write facts](api/facts)
+ [How to write connectors](api/connectors)
+ [API reference](api/reference)

## Branches

+ There is a branch per major version, ie `2.x`, that tracks the latest release of that version
+ Changes should generally be based off the latest major branch, unless fixing an old version

## Dev Setup

```sh
# Create a virtualenv with your tool of choice
# python -m venv / pyenv virtualenv / virtualenv

# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:Fizzadar/pyinfra.git

# Install the package in editable mode with development requirements
cd pyinfra
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

## Tests

Use `pytest` to run tests, or `pytest --cov` to run with coverage. Pull requests are expected to be tested and not drop overall project coverage by >1%.

The `setup.cfg` file for `pyinfra` disables the "end-to-end" tests (contained in `tests/end-to-end/`) by default, but they can be run by providing
pytests with a "mark expression":

```
# run end-to-end local tests
pytest -m end_to_end_local

# run end-to-end ssh tests
pytest -m end_to_end_ssh

# run end-to-end docker tests
pytest -m end_to_end_docker
```

## Generate Documentation

To generate:

```sh
sphinx-build -a docs/ docs/build/
```

To view ([localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)):

```sh
python -m http.server -d docs/build/
```

## Code Style

+ 100 max line length
+ no hanging indents
+ single quotes everywhere possible
